  Application Name:
  LuaDataFlowBlocks

  Summary:
  Serving Lua functions and events as data flow blocks

  Description:
  This sample shows how functions and events from scripts can be served as data flow
  blocks. These then can be wired conveniently using the flow editor. In this sample
  two functions and one event are declared and served in the script and in the AppManifest.
  Adding 'Include data-flow' statement to the served function/event in the AppManifest
  makes them available as data flow blocks.
  An event with at least one parameter becomes a provider block.
  A function with at least one parameter and at least one return value becomes a processor block.
  A function with at least one parameter and no return value becomes a consumer block.

  How to run:
  To demo this sample, it must be loaded to any device or the emulator. The output
  of the consumer function can be seen at the console.

  Implementation:
  In order to make the created flow blocks appear in BlocksBrowser and to be opened in
  FlowEditor it is required that the App, which is serving the blocks, is deployed to
  the device.
